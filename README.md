## Be a geoscience detective ##

<font color=green>In this repo I resume work done at the [2018 Geophysics Sprint](https://mycarta.wordpress.com/2019/02/07/geophysics-python-sprint-2018-day-2-and-beyond-part-ii) (orgainzed by Agile Scientific ahead of the Annual SEG conference), which resulted in the [error flag demo notebook](https://github.com/mycarta/in-bruges/blob/master/notebooks/Error_flag_demo.ipynb) in the repo (in-bruges](https://github.com/mycarta/in-bruges).  

<font color=green>I was inspired to go back to it after watching a Stanford University webinar titled [How to be a statistical detective](https://learn.stanford.edu/WBN-MED-STATS-On-Demand-2020-02-05_LP-OD-Registration-2020-02-11.html). 
    
#### The notebook is for a live lightning talk at the [Transform 2020 virtual conference](https://transform2020.sched.com/) organized by [Software Underground](https://softwareunderground.org/). __More details coming soon__.
